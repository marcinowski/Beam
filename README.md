# Beam

## 1. Goals

* Creating a program for simple beam calculations using Finite Element Method [FEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method)
* Creating a medium sized structure in Python without dependencies
* Using GitHub

## 2. GUI-s

In general the project should consist of two parts: engine and GUI. I plan to work on 
 * console GUI
 * more advanced graphic GUI (haven't picked up any technology yet, but maybe Kivi?)
 * there's a possibility of porting the whole thing to be a web app
